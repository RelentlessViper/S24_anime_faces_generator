# S24_anime_faces_generator

In this project we utilize the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture to generate high quality anime images.

Right now we only have 2 branches: "main" and auto encoder.

"main" branch contains "main.ipynb" - implemented and trained GAN (Generative Adversarial Network).

"autoencoder" branch contains "autoencoder.ipynb" - auto encoder architecture trained on anime faces dataset.

We present a novel approach to image generation using GANs and Autoencoders. We trained both models on an Anime Faces dataset and evaluated their performance. Our findings show that the GAN model outperforms the Autoencoder in terms of image quality and diversity. Our approach can be applied to other image generation tasks, such as generating realistic human faces or other types of images.
